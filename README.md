# AI Web App Builder (Simple)

A lightweight, testable version of an AI-powered web app builder.  
This application accepts task requests, generates web applications using local or LLM-assisted generators, optionally deploys them to GitHub, and notifies an evaluator API. Designed for educational purposes and safe local testing.

---

## Features

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /ready` : Accepts task requests, verifies the secret, schedules background tasks for app generation and deployment.
  - `POST /evaluation-receiver` : Receives evaluation notifications (for testing purposes).
  - `GET /status` : Check the last received task and running background jobs.
  - `GET /health` : Simple health check endpoint.
  - `GET /logs` : Retrieve the latest application logs.

- **Background Job**:
  - Generates files (`index.html`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`) based on task brief.
  - Saves attachments (images, CSV, JSON) from data URIs or URLs.
  - Supports concurrency with a configurable semaphore.

- **Deployment**:
  - Optional GitHub repo creation and push.
  - Optional GitHub Pages deployment.
  - Supports a dry-run mode for local testing without network calls.

- **LLM Integration**:
  - Can call Aipipe/OpenRouter to generate production-ready HTML, README, and LICENSE files.
  - Handles attachments intelligently: images, text files, and metadata.
